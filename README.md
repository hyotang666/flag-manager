flag-manager
============

flag-manager is common lisp library for managing the flags.

But in fact, this is for learning usage of git & github to me.
I am not interested in flag-manager is useful or not.

Flag-manager is inspired by Takashi Hirayama's book "ゲームプログラマになる前に覚えておきたい技術".(means "The basic technics for game programing" in english.)
It is case study for C++, so flag-manager has imperative style but lisp style.
